Mx1 Assignment 1 (FPGA) Archive

This is the archive of my FPGA code from Mechatronics Assignment 1. 
Features latest version + all backup previous versions used prior to version control.

This is an FPGA set up to get data from an Ultrasonic sensor, convert it into microseconds and display it on a 7-segment display. It also controls a stepper motor, designed to move the ultrasonic sensor back and forth over a 180 degree fov.
